# Pokefetch
This project is a fusion between the pokeget and the neofetch tools.

So obviously you must have them installed:
**[Neofetch]**: https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch
**[Pokeget]**: https://github.com/talwat/pokeget-rs?tab=readme-ov-file

## How to use it
You can use it as simple, so it will appear a random pokemon
```sh
pokefetch
```
Or if you have a favorite one you can also added with the pokedex number
```sh
pokefetch 3
```
